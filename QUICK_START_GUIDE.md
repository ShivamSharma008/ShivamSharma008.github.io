# ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Text Overlapping While Scrolling ✅
**Before:** Text in the experience section was overlapping when scrolling down the page.

**Fixed by:**
- Increased `z-index` of `.timeline-content` from default to `5`
- Added `margin-bottom: 1rem` to create proper spacing between cards
- Now all experience cards stack properly without any overlap

---

### Issue 2: Dot Over "Oceaneering Mobile Robotics" ✅
**Before:** Timeline dot was appearing over the company name, looking unprofessional.

**Fixed by:**
- Hidden all timeline dots by setting `display: none` in `.timeline-dot` CSS
- This creates a cleaner, more modern look
- The vertical timeline line remains visible for visual flow

---

### Issue 3: Download Resume Button ✅
**Before:** Clicking "Download Resume" showed alert: "Resume download will be available soon!"

**Fixed by:**
- Created a professional, comprehensive PDF resume (`Shivam_Sharma_Resume.pdf`)
- Updated button from alert to actual download link
- Now clicking the button downloads the PDF immediately
