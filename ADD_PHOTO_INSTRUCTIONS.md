# How to Add Your Profile Photo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Locate your photo**: 
   - Find the file: `Gemini_Generated_Image_5tvkyc5tvkyc5tvk` in your Downloads folder
   - If it has an extension like `.jpg` or `.png`, note it

2. **Copy the photo to portfolio folder**:
   - Copy the file to: `C:\mp-omr-athena-application-engineering\shivam-portfolio-live\`
   - Rename it to: `profile-photo.png` (or `profile-photo.jpg`)

3. **Update the HTML if needed**:
   - If you used `.jpg`, open `index.html`
   - Find line with: `<img src="profile-photo.png"`
   - Change to: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg"`

4. **Commit and push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   cd C:\mp-omr-athena-application-engineering\shivam-portfolio-live
   git add profile-photo.png
   git commit -m "Add profile photo"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Note**: If you can't find the exact file `Gemini_Generated_Image_5tvkyc5tvkyc5tvk`, you can use any of the other Gemini images in your Downloads folder. Just rename whichever one you choose to `profile-photo.png`.
